<h1>TIC TAC TOE</h1>

<h2>Project Description:</h2>
Javascript based TIC TAC TOE game.  Although this game is a simple one to play
the logic behind finding a winner is very complex.  I added to the complexity by making
this game completely dynamic (game board and win conditions created based on input).

<h2>Feature List:</h2>
- Multiplayer
- Infinite board size capability
- Tracks which player's turn it is, and use the current player's symbol
- Generates win conditions dynamically
- Game board created dynamically based on input.

<h2>3 Things I learned:</h2>
 - Dynamic DOM creation
 - Complex Loop design logic
 - How to pair program
